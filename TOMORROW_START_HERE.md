# 🚀 Sales Scorecard - Tomorrow's Starting Point

## 📋 **Current Status: COMPLETE MVP READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

### ✅ **What's Already Built & Working:**
- **Complete Authentication System** - Password-based login with bcrypt hashing
- **Role-Based Access Control** - ADMIN, REGIONAL_MANAGER, SALES_LEAD, SALESPERSON
- **User Management System** - Full CRUD operations with admin panel
- **Professional Admin Panel** - User creation, management, email notifications
- **Security Features** - JWT tokens, CORS, proper password hashing
- **Email Notifications** - AWS SES integration for user creation
- **Mobile-Ready API** - iOS app integration ready
- **Database Schema** - Complete Prisma schema with all models

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite
- **Authentication**: bcryptjs + JWT
- **Security**: Role-based guards, CORS, validation
- **Email**: AWS SES integration
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with Swagger docs

### 📱 **Ready for Client Use:**
- User registration and login
- Admin panel for user management
- Role-based permissions
- Email notifications
- Mobile app integration
- Production-ready security

## 🎯 **TOMORROW'S PRIORITY: Fix Railway Deployment**

### ❌ **Current Issue:**
Railway build keeps failing with:
```
error TS2307: Cannot find module 'bcryptjs' or its corresponding type declarations.
error TS2353: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'password' does not exist in type
```

### 🔧 **Root Cause:**
Railway is not properly:
1. Installing bcryptjs dependency
2. Generating Prisma client with password field
3. Running our custom build script

### 💡 **Solutions to Try Tomorrow:**

#### Option 1: Fix Railway Build Process
- Ensure build script runs properly
- Fix Prisma client generation
- Verify all dependencies are installed

#### Option 2: Alternative Deployment
- Try different deployment platform (Vercel, Render, etc.)
- Use Docker deployment
- Deploy to AWS ECS (we already have infrastructure)

#### Option 3: Simplify for Railway
- Remove bcryptjs temporarily
- Use simpler authentication
- Get basic app running first

## 📁 **Key Files to Focus On:**
- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `build.sh` - Custom build script
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `src/auth/auth.service.ts` - Authentication logic
- `src/admin/admin.service.ts` - User management
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration

## 🚀 **Quick Start Commands:**
```bash
cd /Users/zaharivassilev/SalesScorecard/sales-scorecard-api
git status  # Check current state
git log --oneline -5  # See recent commits
```

## 📊 **What's Working Locally:**
- All TypeScript compiles without errors
- Prisma generates client correctly
- All authentication endpoints work
- Admin panel functions properly
- User management system complete

## 🎯 **Success Criteria for Tomorrow:**
1. ✅ Railway deployment succeeds
2. ✅ API endpoints respond correctly
3. ✅ Admin panel accessible
4. ✅ User creation works
5. ✅ Authentication flow complete
6. ✅ iOS app can connect

## 📝 **Notes:**
- All code is committed and ready
- Custom build script created but not working on Railway
- AWS infrastructure already set up as backup
- Test script available: `test-mvp.js`
- Complete MVP is built - just need deployment
